    <!-- 
    The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a
    huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollar bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.

    Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.

    Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly
    in the order people queue?

    Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to every person and give change with the bills he has at hand at that moment.
    Otherwise return NO.

    Examples:
    tickets([25, 25, 50]) // => YES
    tickets([25, 100]) // => NO. Vasya will not have enough money to give change to 100 dollars
    tickets([25, 25, 50, 50, 100]) // => NO. Vasya will not have the right bills to give 75 dollars of change (you can't
    make two bills of 25 from one of 50) -->
